In this assignment, I have used an AJAX get method to retrieve list of content and display them into a list as shown:
Get Method URL :  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
Ex: Response:
{
    "albumId": 1,
    "id": 1,
    "title": "accusamus beatae ad facilis cum similique qui sunt",
    "url": "https://via.placeholder.com/600/92c952",
    "thumbnailUrl": "https://via.placeholder.com/150/92c952"
  },

 I have also used title, albumId & thumbnailUrl for list view, and when you click on the thumbnail, it opens an actual image.
